Fitness TrackerOverviewFitness Tracker is a web application designed to help users create and log workouts using preset exercises managed by site administrators. Users can take advantage of shared workouts if they are marked as public, create personalized workout splits, and track their progress. The app supports progress tracking by allowing users to mark workouts as complete and input details like weight and repetitions for each set. Completed workouts contribute to a user's streak, similar to GitHub's streak feature, and are used to recommend new weights.FeaturesCreate and Log Workouts: Users can create personalized workouts using a set of pre-defined exercises.
